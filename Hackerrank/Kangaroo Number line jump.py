# You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

# The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
# The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
# You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

# After one jump, they are both at , (, ), so the answer is YES.

# Function Description

# Complete the function kangaroo in the editor below.

# kangaroo has the following parameter(s):

# int x1, int v1: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
# int x2, int v2: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 2
# Returns

# string: either YES or NO
# Input Format

# A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of , , , and .

# Constraints

# Sample Input 0

# 0 3 4 2
# Sample Output 0

# YES
# Explanation 0

# The two kangaroos jump through the following sequence of locations:

# image

# From the image, it is clear that the kangaroos meet at the same location (number  on the number line) after same number of jumps ( jumps), and we print YES.

# Sample Input 1

# 0 2 5 3
# Sample Output 1

# NO
# Explanation 1

# The second kangaroo has a starting location that is ahead (further to the right) of the first kangaroo's starting location (i.e., ). Because the second kangaroo moves at a faster rate (meaning ) and is already ahead of the first kangaroo, the first kangaroo will never be able to catch up. Thus, we print NO.
